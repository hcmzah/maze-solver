# maze-solver
parse 2d maze images and find the optimal path using dijkstra/a*

the program loads a maze image, converts it into a binary grid, and performs pathfinding between selected start and end coordinates

## features
- image-based maze parsing (png, jpg)  
- pixel classification into wall / path  
- manual start and end point selection  
- dijkstra or a* algorithm execution  
- path rendering  
- zoom, pan, and grid display  
- configurable colours, transparency, etc.
